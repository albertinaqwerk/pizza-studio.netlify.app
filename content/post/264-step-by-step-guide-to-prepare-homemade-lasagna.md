recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 180C. For the tomato sauce, finely dice the onions and mince the garlic. In a wok or large frying pan on medium heat add the oil."
- "Add the onions and sauté until soft and translucent. Stir occasionally to prevent onions burning."
- "Now add the mince beef and break up the meat. Stir the meat from time to time to ensure even cooking. Once the meat is almost cooked add the garlic and stir."
- "Once the meat is fully cooked add tin tomatoes and water to the wok. Turn heat up to high and bring to a boil."
- "Once boiling add the basil, bay leaved and oregano and combine well. Add tomato puree and sugar. Stir well before seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. If using Tabasco add now. This helps to add a little spice to the dish and elevates the flavours of the sauce. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer between half hour to 1 hour covering with a lid. For best results let it simmer for as long as possible to let the flavours develop. Stir the sauce occasionally."
- "In the meantime make the white sauce. In a medium sauce pan on low heat, add the butter and let it melt. Slowly add the flour bit by bit."
- "Keep stirring continuously until a paste forms (or becomes a crumble like texture called a &#39;roux&#39;, the basis for many sauces). Continue cooking and stirring for a couple more minutes. Now add the milk very gradually to the roux. Stir gently until it develops into a smooth consistency. Cook for a further 5-10 mins, stirring continuously, until the sauce has thickened."
- "When the white sauce has thickened, add a sprinkle of nutmeg (optional) and stir well. Add dijon mustard now if using and stir (optional). Lastly, season to taste with salt and pepper. Give it a final good stir and remove from heat."
- "Once the tomato sauce and white sauce are both done it is time to assemble the lasagne. In an ovenproof dish put one third of the meat sauce in the base, then spoon one third of the white sauce on top."
- "Arrange one layer of lasagne sheets on top. Optional step: my little twist on extra cheesy layers of lasagne. Add the grated mozzarella on top of the lasagne sheets to cover. If leaving the cheese layers in between then repeat steps 9 &amp; 10 until the tomato and white sauce has been used up. Generously sprinkle over the mozzarella cheese on the final layer. If using cherry tomatoes, add now and layer on top (optional). Sprinkle and season with salt and pepper on top (optional)."
- "Cover lasagne with foil and bake for 40-45 minutes. Once lasagne has been baking for 30 minutes remove the foil and let it bake for the remaining duration. In order to let the cheese on top crisp up."
- "Be careful when removing lasagne from the oven as it will be bubbling on top and very hot."
- "Serve and eat immediately. I like to eat mine with a side salt as well to cut through the richness of the lasagne."

Mexican lasagna makes great leftovers, too! You can even serve it with eggs for breakfast. From Italian lasagna (and its plural lasagne), possibly from Vulgar Latin *lasania, from Latin lasanum (&#34;cooking pot&#34;), from Ancient Greek λάσανον (lásanon, &#34;trivet or stand for a pot&#34;). Others argue the Italian lasagna originally derived from the Arabic لَوْزِينَج‎ (lawzīnaj, &#34;almond cake&#34;).

Now add the milk very gradually to the roux. Stir gently until it develops into a smooth consistency. Cook for a further 5-10 mins, stirring continuously, until the sauce has thickened.

1. Once the tomato sauce and white sauce are both done it is time to assemble the lasagne. In an ovenproof dish put one third of the meat sauce in the base, then spoon one third of the white sauce on top.
1. Arrange one layer of lasagne sheets on top. Optional step: my little twist on extra cheesy layers of lasagne. Add the grated mozzarella on top of the lasagne sheets to cover. If leaving the cheese layers in between then repeat steps 9 &amp; 10 until the tomato and white sauce has been used up. Generously sprinkle over the mozzarella cheese on the final layer.

1. Be careful when removing lasagne from the oven as it will be bubbling on top and very hot.
1. Serve and eat immediately. I like to eat mine with a side salt as well to cut through the richness of the lasagne.


This bechamel-based lasagna is still seriously luxurious. This white lasagna involves the clever hack of using egg roll wrappers instead of noodles (which means no boiling). Pasta noodles piled high and layered full of three kinds of cheese to go along with the perfect blend of meaty and zesty, tomato pasta sauce all loaded with herbs. Lasagna has many versions, both within Italy and around the world, but when we talk about &#34;real&#34; lasagna in Italy we mean &#34;Lasagna alla Bolognese&#34; i.e., from Bologna in the region of Emilia-Romagna. This lasagna recipe is super simple to make, and so flavorful.
