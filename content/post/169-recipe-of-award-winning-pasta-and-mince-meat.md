Last week I made this wonderful mincemeat and Pasta. Pasta with mince sauce is wonderfully paired with a bowl of homemade yogurt in our house. I even drizzle some yogurt on it and oh my it gets even tastier! Some people love their pasta cold with yogurt or as a salad if it&#39;s summer time, some love it with various vegetables, some love it with cheese, meat.

This recipe of Mince and Pasta Bake is the perfect meal to prepare for that back-to-routine kind of days. (Because I totally love it) Enjoying delicious pasta and mince with creamy b√©chamel sauce, cheese and herbs baked in the oven - comfort me in a way that a piece of fish would never do! Mincemeat is a mixture of chopped dried fruit, distilled spirits and spices, and sometimes beef suet, beef, or venison. Many modern recipes contain beef suet, though vegetable shortening is sometimes used in its place. My One Pot Shrimp Pasta and my Mushroom and Garlic Butter Pasta are also on regular rotation You could even add mushrooms to this pasta recipe instead of meat to create a vegetarian version of this. Add a cooking spoonful of Vegetable oil into a pan on medium heat.
