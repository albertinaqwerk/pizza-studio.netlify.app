I like them because they are convenient, quick cooking and more flavorful than chicken breasts. For the Korean chicken marinade, we use soy sauce, ginger, garlic, brown sugar, rice vinegar, and gochujang. I&#39;ve got another great chicken recipe to make on the grill. I made this recipe with chicken thighs to keep the chicken tender and juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Simply add all of the sauce ingredients to a resealable Ziplock bag, add in the chicken and toss to coat.
