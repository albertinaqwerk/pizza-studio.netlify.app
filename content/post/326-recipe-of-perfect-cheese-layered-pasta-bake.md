Anything with meat, cheese and pasta is usually a winner in my book, but the sour cream layer in this. Layer the ingredients in the prepared baking dish as follows: half of the cooked pasta, all the provolone cheese, all the sour cream, half of the sauce. The smell of pasta, tomato sauce, and cheese baking together is one of life&#39;s most comforting scents. I know that what&#39;s going to come out of the oven will appeal to Layer half the mozzarella into the pasta and reserve half for the top. It bakes up golden-brown â€” the hallmark of a good pasta casserole.
