recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 190 degree celsius or 375 fahrenheit.  Peel, core and halved the apples.  *Apples oxidize super fast in the place I reside. I submerge my apples in a combination of water, salt and fresh lemon juice. This will prevent the apples from oxidizing too fast.*"
- "In a large mixing bowl, add melted butter, muscovado sugar and cinnamon.  Mix until sugar has dissolved.  Add in the apples.  Toss well until the apples are coated well with the butter mixture."
- "Set aside.  In an oven proof skillet over medium heat, add butter, sugar and cream of tartar.  *If you do not have cream of tartar, you can replace it with 1 TBSP of fresh lemon juice.*"
- "Swirl the skillet until butter and sugar are well combined.  Continue cooking until bubbles start to form slowly.  Add in apple brandy.  Swirl to combine well."
- "Continue cooking until bubbles start to form again.  Remove from heat.  Lay the in the apples, cut side up.  Try to lay the apples closely to one another."
- "Drizzle any leftover liquid from the melted butter mixture over the apples.  Return back to the heat and continue cooking until bubbles start to form again.  Wack into the oven and bake for 15 mins."
- "While the apples are baking, roll out puff pastry to about 1/4 thick and slightly bigger than your skillet.  You don&#39;t have to roll out into a perfect circle.  After 15 mins, remove the skillet of apples from the oven.  Carefully place the puff pastry over the apples."
- "Use an offset spatula to tuck the sides of the puff pastry into the apples.  Lastly, prick holes gently on the puff pastry with a fork.  Return to the oven and continue baking for about 20 to 30 mins or until the puff pastry turns golden brown."
- "Remove from oven and set aside to cool down for 30 mins.  Use an offset spatula and run the sides to loosen the puff pastry.  Place a large plate, which is bigger than your skillet, over the puff pastry."
- "Confidently flip.  Voila. You can see how beautiful the apple tarte tartin is.  Slice and serve immediately."
