Who doesn&#39;t love pasta drenched in a meaty tomato sauce! Another option and a family favourite is Spaghetti Carbonara, which I also make often! Despite growing up in an Irish family, at least once a week we channeled our inner Italian and enjoyed this Italian classic. This sauce is ideal for spaghetti, but can be used with any kind of pasta - great for Lasagna as well. This is perhaps the best spaghetti bolognese recipe you&#39;ll ever have.
