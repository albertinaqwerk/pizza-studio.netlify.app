recipeinstructions:
- "Spray frying pan with oil and heat. Place salmon fillets, skin side down in pan. Either cook for about 6mins on each side or cover with lid and don&#39;t turn over for about 12mins..cover with lid, this means the skin sticks to the pan and comes off the fillet when cooked. I don&#39;t like skin.You can see when they are cooked, they are pink all through."
