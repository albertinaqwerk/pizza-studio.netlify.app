recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 200ยบ"
- "Put all of the ingredients into a bowl and mix thoroughly. I&#39;m making a tomato sauce so any herb or spice can be used.

- "Add all of the seasonings - salt, pepper, sugar, herbs/spices and stir in. Allow the sauce a few minutes to simmer then add the wine if you&#39;re using it, otherwise keep simmering and adding the water for another 10 minutes"
- "At this point you have a basic tomato sauce, I&#39;m going to blend mine into a puree, but you can leave it chunky and add in thick cut vegetables during the simmering time such as courgette and red pepper. Or if you like just a nice rustic sauce to serve with your pasta then whilst cooking the onion add chunks of chorizo and lardons (chunks of bacon) then vegetables at the simmering stage"
- "Choose your pasta - I prefer spaghetti but the children like fusilli - you can use any pasta of your choice"
- "Drain your cooked pasta and either pour in the sauce and set it over a low heat to allow the pasta to absorb the liquids from the sauce and add the meatballs whilst stirring gently to ensure there is no sticking  or pile up your pasta, arrange your meatballs and pour over the sauce"
- "It&#39;s even better with a little fresh grated parmesan cheese either on the top of the dish or stirred into the plain pasta before serving"
