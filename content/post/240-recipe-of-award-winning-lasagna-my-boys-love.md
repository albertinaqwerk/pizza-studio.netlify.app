recipeinstructions:
- "Dice the carrot, celery and red onion. Saute them in the oil for 5 mins. Add the garlic, tomato paste and sage. When softened add the pork mince to brown."
- "Put the oven on to 220° to heat up whilst you prepare the other parts."
- "When the mince is brown add the pasata and bring to the boil. Then turn down to a low slow simmer for about 25 mins."
- "In a separate pan- snip the bacon in and fry it off. Then add the spinach to wilt in the pan and coat in the bacon fat. Once its wilted let it cool a little and mix it in a bowl with the ricotta and a couple of spoons of grated parmesan."
- "Then in a third pan melt the butter and stir in the flour. Cook the roux for a few minutes and whisk in the milk to make a bechamel. Season this with black pepper and nutmeg. Keep stirring until it thickens."
- "Place the lasagna dish (oven proof) on a baking sheet. Then add the first layer of meat sauce. Follow by a layer of pasta. Then add the spinach ricotta layer and more pasta. Then more meat sauce and a final layer of pasta. Pour the bechamel on top and lift it into the oven (the tray catches any stray bits that bubble up and stops it dripping down to the oven floor to burn and give you a nasty oven to clean)."
- "Keep it baking for about 30 mins then lift it out. Sprinkle over grated cheddar and put back in for another 15 mins."
- "Serve alone or with a crisp salad. The day wasn&#39;t so bad after all."
