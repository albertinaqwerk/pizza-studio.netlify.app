recipeinstructions:
- "Pasta: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Season with a handful of salt (it should be salty as the Mediterranean Sea, as they say). Boil the pasta as per package instructions (10min or so?). Reserve some pasta water for the sauce, about a cup. Drain pasta in a colander and add olive oil or butter to prevent clumping."
- "Meatballs: soak breadcrumbs in milk. Beat eggs with salt, pepper and herbs. Mix together with minced meat, breadcrumb mixture and the rest of the ingredients. Form into balls and cook in a wide frying pan with olive oil till nicely charred, flipping as needed."
- "Cream sauce: Saute the minced garlic and onion in a pat of butter (about 2 tbsp). Add chicken stock cube. At this point, if you wish to add mushrooms or minced meat (if forgoing meatballs) you can do so now."
- "Add the cream and some milk. Keep the heat at a simmer and not a boil. Gradually whisk in the cream cheese. Add bay leaves and other herbs. Constantly stirring."
- "Add another pat of butter, some parmesan and pasta water for salt and texture, milk to neutralise the saltiness or increase the volume of the cream sauce. Salt to taste. This is where you play by ear in how creamy or salty you want your sauce to be."
- "Serve pasta with a ladle full of cream sauce coating the linguine, 2-3 meatballs a plate, add a sprinkle of parsley if you&#39;re feeling fancy. Store leftovers in fridge and heat up with a little milk each time."
