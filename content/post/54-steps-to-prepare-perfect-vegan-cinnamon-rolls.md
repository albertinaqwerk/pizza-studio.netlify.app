recipeingredient:
- "6 tablespoons vegan butter or margarine"
- "2 1/4 teaspoons instant dry yeast"
- "250 ml vegan milk of your choice I went with soy milk"
- "100 grams sugar"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "385 grams flour"
- "250 grams finely chopped walnuts optional"
- "1 tablespoon ground cinnamon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add the vegan butter and the milk to a pan and heat them up until the butter is melted."
- "Cool down the butter mixture to a bathing temperature (not too hot or you will kill the yeast) and then add in the yeast. Mix the yeast in and then leave that for 10 minutes to activate. You should get lots of bubbles at the end of the 10 minutes."
- "Add the sugar and the salt to the yeast mixture and stir gently."
- "Add the flour to the mixture 1 cup at a time (aprox. 100 grams) and when you cannot stir the mixture anymore, get your fingers dirty and take it out onto a floured surface. You might not need the entire flour quantity."
- "You want to have a sticky but somewhat manageable dough at this step. Knead the dough for a couple of minutes and then oil a bowl, form the dough in a ball shape and place it in the bowl. Place a clean cloth on the bowl and leave it to rest for an hour in a warm place. I chose a sunny spot in my kitchen but anything will do. At the end of this hour, you should have a dough that is twice in size."
- "Preheat your oven to 180C. Roll the dough on a floured surface in a thin layer (half an inch or less) in a square shape. Brush it with some melted vegan butter and then add the sugar and cinnamon. I’ve also added diced walnuts but anything could work here, there’s no rules!"
- "Roll the dough up. I’ve previously cut my square into 2 pieces for easing this step."
- "Cut the dough rolls into 1.5 inch pieces, place them in a pan previously layered with a baking sheet. Brush the rolls with vegan butter."
- "Bake the rolls for about 30 minutes or until lightly brown."
