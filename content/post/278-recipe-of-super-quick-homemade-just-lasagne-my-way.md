We&#39;ve used blanched dried pasta but you can use fresh egg pasta - just don&#39;t precook it. A lasagne is basically the same recipe as my Spaghetti Bolognese but I just don&#39;t add any carrots. I always put the lasagne sheets on first, I don&#39;t know if it makes a difference, it&#39;s just the way I do things. If there is a reason I should be doing it the other way around please do let me know.
